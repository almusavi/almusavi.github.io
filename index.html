<h2>Best Lines from Swingers</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>How long do I wait to call</li>
  <li>You're so money and you don't even know it</li>
  <li>You know what you are? You're like a big bear with claws and with fangs...</li>
  <li>Um... a malt Glen Garry for me and my friend here. And if you tell that bartender to go extra easy on the water, this 50 cent piece has your name on it.</li>
  <li>Hey! What're you kicking me for? You want me to ask? All right, I'll ask! Ma'am, where do the high school girls hang out in this town?
</li>
<li>I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie everyone's *really* hoping makes it happen. I want you to be like the guy in the rated R movie, you know, the guy you're not sure whether or not you like yet. You're not sure where he's coming from. Okay? You're a bad man. You're a bad man, Mikey. You're a bad man, bad man.</li>
<li>This place is dead anyways.</li>
<li>You're a big winner. I'm gonna ask you a simple question and I want you to listen to me: who's the big winner here tonight at the casino? Huh? Mikey, that's who. Mikey's the big winner. Mikey wins.</li>
<li>Vegas, baby. Vegas.</li>
<li>Haven't you seen Boyz N The Hood? Now one of us is going to get shot.</li>
<li>Excuse me darling. I'm sorry. Wow. I want you to remember this face here, OK, this is the guy behind the guy behind the guy.</li>
<li>So let me get this straight. The party started at eight. Why are we going to a bar at ten?</li>
